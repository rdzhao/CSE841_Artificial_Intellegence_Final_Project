# CSE841_Artificial_Intellegence_Final_Project

This project applies Satisfiability Problem Encoding for solving sudoku problems. 
This method is extremely fast for even evil sudoku problems.

The normal backtrack based method may take forever to run. 
However, the SAT encoding will solve them in a blink of an eye.

For more details, see project report.
